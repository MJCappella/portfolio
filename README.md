# Portfolio
This is my personal portfolio website. It includes everything about me from social life, academic background, career choices amongst other amazing staff. Built with only the basic web technologies: HTML, CSS and vanilla JS. No frameworks used whatsoever. I intend to make changes little by little as I progress into the dynamic field of Software engineering, with a focus on the frontend styling and serverside request handling.
To run the project, just run the <strong>index.html</strong> file and everything will work just fine.
